	<h1>About me</h1>
    <p>What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I have tried adding more aspects in styling for in css but did not want to spend too much on it. I attempted to create a navigation bar but I needed more time and knowledge so I didn't end up creating one for this project.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Which parts did you have trouble with?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using sql queries with php and having them interact with each other. I had most trouble with with poststatusprocess because of how many checks in the data there had to be, with so much checks it was hard to pinpoint where the problem was in the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What would you like to do better next time?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>become more faster in solving and doing the tasks as I took a long time on the processes because I wasn't too familiar with the syntax. Also be better in finding problems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Websites that helped me with syntax like the php manual, w3schools on top of the lecture and lab notes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What have you learnt along the way?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting a website with a database through mysql and be able to manipulate data using php.</li>
    </ul>
